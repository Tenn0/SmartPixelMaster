This is the master of my Smartpixel project. It is the brain of the project, handling remote communication with computers over
serial connection; the time-based moodlight and such things.
For communication with the slave and the RTC it uses IÂ²C.

Since its for from ready, I will update this from time to time.

For displaying at the strip, you need the slave at https://github.com/Tenn0/SmartPixelSlave
